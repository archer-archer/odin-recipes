# odin-recipes

This is my first GitHub project done using the Odin Project's self taught Javascript full stack course. 
I am primarily doing this to develop programming skills but mainly working in a developer environment.
That entails working on projects and self-management. 

This project is a basic recipes website, mainly done with html.
